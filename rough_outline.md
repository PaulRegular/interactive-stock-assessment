**Improving the communication and transparency of stock assessment using interactive visualization tools**


General paragraph on the role of stock assessment, the process, and the increasing complexity of data inputs and models.







History of data inputs (catch at age, indices). Growing long term monitoring time-series (indices, tagging, etc.). Complexity. Multi-dimensional.







Evolution of stock assessment models. Growth in computing power. Integration of more data inputs. Ensemble modeling.







Enter visualization tools. Advances make it easier than ever to produce interactive visualizations. Makes it easier to explore complex data inputs and model outputs. Improve transparency and communication of stock assessment.
